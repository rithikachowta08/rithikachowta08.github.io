      <p>
        I am a CSE graduate from the batch of 2014-18. I started out as a
        frontend dev working with ReactJS and Redux. Over the years, I&apos;ve
        worked with multiple technologies including and not limited to{" "}
        <strong>NextJS, NodeJS, Flask, MongoDB and GoLang</strong>. My strength
        lies in frontend with over 5 years experience, followed by backend
        experience of 1 year 🎯. Adding backend skills to my arsenal has been
        transformational in my understanding of how the web works ✨.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked on integrations and deployments of cutting edge LLMs
        like <strong>GPT-4o, Gemini and Phi-3</strong>, which was an altogether
        new and explorative domain for me 🧠. I have an obsessive need for
        perfection that works against me at times but I thoroughly enjoy
        discovering new tech and its challenges. Surmounting those challenges
        often bring forth new learning that I can apply in more than one domain.
      </p>

        Outside of work, I love to spend my time baking sweet treats 🍰, both
        for hoomans and for my pup 🐶. I also love fitness and am a
        self-confessed health nut 🏋🏻‍♀️. Painting 🎨 and reading 📖 are 2 more of
        my interests that I find joy in whenever I can 🌈.
